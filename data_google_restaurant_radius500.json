Unfortunately, the lovely meal was overshadowed by a very poorly offered and executed ‚ÄúHappy Hour‚Äù. I first attempted to order a glass of either white or red wine that was BOGO until 8pm. After some time, I was told they were out of both. Then I attempted to order one of the cocktails, after a few moments I was told I had to join their membership to receive the BOGO. At that point I said forget it. Clearly, they want to make it as difficult as possible to not fulfill the Happy Hour. I don‚Äôt even live here-why would I want to join your ‚Äúmembership‚Äù. After dinner, we went to take in the views from the outdoor terrace. We tried to order the Minty Crush, which was on the Hapoy Hour menu, understanding the Happy Hour BOGO was over at this point; however, the bartender said he could not make the drink after 8:00pm. Very annoyed by the entire situation, we left feeling less than satisfied with the service at two different areas of the establishment. Food was good. Burnt ends, salmon, peanut sauce on the roast chicken was a little overpowering, smashed potatoes were amazing and bone marrow cr√®me br√ªl√©e was a quirky presentation with a cr√®me br√ªl√©e that was kind of gummy and didn‚Äôt taste nearly as unique or extravagant as it sounded or looked. Bill was still about $130 USD.",

Everything was insanely delicious, with the pineapple fried rice standing out as the absolute best.\n\nThe portions are quite generous for one person; even though we're not big eaters, we felt satisfyingly full after enjoying the dessert.

I was very impressed with the presentation as the rice itself was served inside of a half cut fresh pineapple. The service staff was also very friendly and the food came fast even though there was a bit of a crowd.

All of them were delicious but for me the most special one was the Grilled Chicken.\n\nAll of the food and drink were tasted amazing, but i really disappointed with the service.

The ordering system is simple, concise and fast: seemingly like a fast food establishment and the food preparation is really quick, perfect for those in a rush. I ordered the mix (beef and chicken) rice platter and it was honestly such a hearty, well-balanced meal with half the platter filled with rice, hefty amount of proteins along with fresh crunchy salad on the side.\n\nThe meat and rice is drenched with a generous amount of their glorious white sauce (likely garlic mayo) and tangy BBQ sauce which really creates a harmony of flavor to savor. Beware tho, their red chilli sauce is really spicy (the bitter kind of spicy) so I recommend requesting it separated from the two other sauce if you dislike spicy food. The service here is also exceptional, the staffs are attentive and kind in adhering to our requests/customizations. Portion is also quite decent for the affordable of the food here.

I like the fact that they hv different promotion almost everyday and they offer free membership and give you more promotion as their member. For service it was a bit slow even on quiet day. Most staffs can be less passionate in serving guests. Also, the place could be quite warm during mid day as their central Aircon doesn't provide enough cool air.",

Crispy skin soaked with teriyaki sauce with tender meat on the inside, almost tempted him ordered another one.\n\nAnother dish that topped my list was the salmon grill, with butter ponzu sauce, recommended for those who favor salty with a touch of sourness, while the salmon teriyaki is the sweet tasting version.\n\nAlso ordered chicken katsu curry, which was also good, crunchy and dry chicken, combined with the thick curry sauce will keep you wanting for more.\n\nHeck, even the miso soup and salad on the side are above average. The meal was also made enjoyable with comfortable setting of warm cored lighting and authentic Japanese ambience",

We were fortunate to be seated at the best table in the corner, offering a breathtaking view of Jakarta at night. The ambiance was simply spectacular.\n\nJakob decided to go for the full set menu, while I opted for the a la carte menu. The beef carpaccio was an absolute standout, melting in our mouths with each bite. However, I must admit that the welcome bread served with olive and balsamic sauce didn't quite meet my expectations.\n\nThe soups we had were nothing short of amazing, especially the mushroom soup which I highly recommend trying. For our main courses, Jakob enjoyed the seabass fish and steak, both of which he loved. As for me, I had the Butter Shoyu pasta with Hokkaido scallops. While the pasta had a slightly sweet taste that didn't quite suit my palate, the scallops and spaghetti were cooked to perfection.\n\nWe concluded our evening with a delightful dessert, creating the perfect sweet memory to end the night. The staff at the restaurant were incredible, providing impeccable service throughout our meal. We will definitely be returning in the future.",

I think out of all the expensive authentic Shabu spots in Jakarta, this is by far my favorite, the price wasn't that bad either.  I liked their üáØüáµ wagyu plate, since I was on a diet so I ordered leaner meat cuts. Sushi rolls were something special also and gyoza was so delicious.\n\nLast visit: November 2023",

Now that they moved to Skybridge it feels a little smaller but way cooler, the design, interior, and all the details. Authentic Thai Cuisine, this restaurant has a Thai select certificate that recognizes the authenticity of its taste. With good price and good atmosphere and the perfect plate for sharing.\nWe‚Äôve been here several times whenever we craved Thai food. The mango sticky rice is the main star, and it's still one of our favorite desserts in Grand Indonesia. The creaminess of the parfait was not too sweet and the freshness & sourness of the mango were just perfect, making the dish taste even better, Highly recommend it to anyone who loves mango sticky rice! Also we love the Thai tea, it was one of the best Thai teas I‚Äôve ever had in Jakarta, not overly sweet also I barely tasted the condensed milk. My suggestion is to give it a try to all their menu, they won‚Äôt fail you, or just simply ask for recommendations for delicious food here. Good luck Tom Tom!\nüê∞‚ô•Ô∏è‚òïÔ∏è",
